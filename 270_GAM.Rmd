The GAMs are additive models that enable to overcome the linearity constraint trough the introduction of more flexible functions of the regressors. In the case of binary classification, we can write such a model as follows: 

$$\log{ \biggl( \frac{P(Y=1|X)}{1-P(Y=1|X) }  \biggr)}=\alpha + \sum_{k=1}^p{f_k(X)}$$

As far as our application is concerned, we consider smoothing splines as transformations of the input features. The optimal degrees of freedom for these functions are selected by 10-fold cross-validation, with a grid search in the range $[1,4]$. Best results are achieved with a value of 4.

As we can see, the generalised additive model shows the best performance in terms of prediction, with an accuracy of 0.7658 and an AUC of 0.8288.
