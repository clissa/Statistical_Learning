In this section we experiment the use of different models for the classification task, and then we compare the results to pick the one that has better out of sample predictions.
The input variables considered in the following are the 12 physical-chemical features plus the variable *type*, with value 1 for white wines and 0 for reds. The target variable is the binary version of *quality*.

As first attempt, we explore the class of *linear methods*, i.e. models that separate each class of the output based on a linear function (or some monotonic transformation).
Alternatively, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) e Generalised Additive Models (GAM) in the final part.
